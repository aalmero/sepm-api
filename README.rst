This is a wrapper around the Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager REST API.
This includes some undocumented endpoints, that may not work as expected.
All the information for the various endpoints were pulled from https://apidocs.securitycloud.symantec.com/.
If you find any bugs please open an issue or a pull request.


NOTE: The Python wrapper API is work in progress and should be treated as a software in beta, especially regarding the "undocumented" API endpoints.
